to remove this package in root folder if reporun  
`python setup.py develop --uninstall`

### Autocomplete for bash  
**Method 1:**  
run the following command every time you use terminal  
`eval "$(_TERMICODER_COMPLETE=source termicoder)"`  

**Method 2:**  
put the following command in your .bashrc  
`eval "$(_TERMICODER_COMPLETE=source termicoder)"`
