## GUIDELINES:
### This document is still being worked out
### Basic things to keep in mind
1. This should be designed so that it can be later made availible as a package in pip etc.  
2. This should be able to be extended to other judges easily so modularity is a priority  
3. The cli should be on similar grounds as git so use commands, arguments and optional arguments judiciously  
4. Since being made in python ensure that it is cross platform (windows ,linux, mac) also try to be compactible with both on python 2 and 3
